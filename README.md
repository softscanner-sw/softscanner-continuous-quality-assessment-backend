# SoftScanner Backend ‚Äì Continuous Quality Assessment Platform
SoftScanner is an **automated continuous quality assessment (CQA) platform** designed for **web applications**. This backend service provides dynamic **instrumentation, telemetry collection and storage, metric computation, and continuous goal assessments** using the **SoftScanner Quality Mapping Model (SSQMM)**, aligned with **ISO/IEC 25010 (2023) standards**.

SoftScanner maps high-level quality goals to observable metrics through **SSQMM**. Each goal assessment is **timestamped**, enabling **historical tracking of quality trends** and **long-term storage for analysis**.

Instrumentation bundles are dynamically generated and deployed to target applications in a non-invasive manner.
The design is **modular and extensible**, making it easy to integrate with different telemetry providers (e.g., tracers, loggers, etc.) and collectors (OTLP, websockets, etc.).
The instrumentation framework is designed to support **both frontend and backend** web applications.
The core instrumentation logic is extended by specific implementations for the generation, bundling, and injection of instrumentation agents.
For example, OpenTelemetry is used to generate automated tracing instrumentation agents for both frontend (*Angular, React*) and backend (*Node.js*) applications, whereas **Webpack** and **esBuild** are used to bundle frontend and backend instrumentation agents respectively.
Moreover, specific implementations are created for the injection of instrumentation agents into Angular, React, and Node.js applications respectively.

## üîß Setup & Installation
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (>= 16.x recommended)
- **npm** (bundled with Node.js)
- **MongoDB** (>= 6.x)
- **TypeScript Compiler**
- **Webpack** (for generating instrumentation bundles)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/softscanner-sw/softscanner-backend.git
cd softscanner-backend
npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Running MongoDB
Create a database named `continuous-quality-assessment-web-telemetry-mongodb` at `localhost:27017`.  
You can use [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) for easy management.

Start MongoDB:
```bash
mongo "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
use "continuous-quality-assessment-web-telemetry-mongodb"
```

Telemetry and assessments are stored in MongoDB or on filesystems. Each instrumentation bundle has associated telemetry data and assessments. This change enables:

- **Long-term storage of quality assessments**
- **Easy retrieval for comparative analysis**
- **Improved monitoring and tracking of quality trends**

#### MongoDB Database Schema
```json
{
  "normalizedAppName": "posts-users-ui-ng",
  "bundles": [
    {
      "name": "posts-users-ui-ng_2025_02_13T13_05_30_915Z.bundle.js",
      "telemetryData": [...],
      "assessments": [
        {
          "goal": "User Engagement",
          "globalScore": 85,
          "timestamp": "2025-02-13T13:05:30Z",
          "details": [
            {
              "metric": "NUU",
              "value": 10,
              "weight": 0.4,
              "timestamp": "2025-02-13T13:05:30Z"
            },
            {
              "metric": "UIF",
              "value": 15,
              "weight": 0.6,
              "timestamp": "2025-02-13T13:05:30Z"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Backend
```bash
npm start
```
This will:
1. **Compile TypeScript files**.
2. **Launch the backend server** (`http://localhost:3000`).
3. **Expose REST API endpoints** for quality assessment.
4. **Enable dynamic instrumentation generation and injection** (*supporting both frontend and backend agents*).
5. **Support telemetry collection, periodic flushing, and live assessment streaming.**

## üì° API Overview
SoftScanner Backend provides structured **RESTful APIs** to interact with **quality models, goals, metrics, and assessments**.

### üîó Key Endpoints
| Method   | Endpoint                            | Description                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **GET**  | `/api/quality-model`                | Retrieves the quality model and associated goals. |
| **POST** | `/api/assessment`                   | Initiates a new quality assessment.               |
| **GET**  | `/api/progress?assessmentId=XYZ`    | Streams live progress updates via SSE.            |
| **GET**  | `/api/assessments?assessmentId=XYZ` | Streams live assessment results continously.      |

---

## üìú Quality Assessment Workflow
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Define Quality Goals and Provide Metadata
Users select relevant **quality goals** and provide application metadata.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Automatic Instrumentation
SoftScanner dynamically generates, bundles, and injects **telemetry agents** for runtime data collection.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection, Storage & Metric Computation
The instrumented application continuously collects **real-time data** (stored in MongoDB or filesystem), and **SoftScanner computes quality metrics** using context-aware goal‚Äìmetric mappings.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Timestamped Goal Assessments
- Each goal stores multiple **timestamped assessments** that capture metric contributions and global scores.  
- Historical tracking enables **trend analysis** and **comparative assessments**.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time API Updates
Users can monitor:  
- **Progress Updates:** `/api/progress` provides live progress notifications via SSE.  
- **Assessment Results:** `/api/assessments` streams real-time quality assessments via SSE.
